    <h1>Cheetahs</h1>
    
    <h2>What are cheetahs?</h2>
    
    <p>The cheetah is a large cat of the subfamily Felinae that occurs in Southern, North and East Africa, and a few localities in Iran. It is the fastest land animal. Its scientific name is Acinonyx jubatus.</p>
    
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    
    <p>In general, the diet of the cheetah consists of gazelles, wildebeest calves, impalas, and smaller hoofed animals in its habitat. Furthermore, cheetahs may eat rabbits, birds, hares, antelopes, and warthogs.</p>
    
    <h2>Lifespan</h2>
    
    <p>The average life span in captivity is 10-12 years though cheetahs can live as long as 20 years. In the wild, few survive more than 8 years though they can live up to 10 or 12 years.</p>
    
    <h2>Height, Weight, & Length</h2>
    
    <p>The Cheetah weighs an average of 83-145 lbs., making them about the same weight as that of a leopard. The length of a Cheetah is approximately 70″-86″ from the tip of the nose to the end of the tail. Being an extremely tall cat the Cheetah stands at an average of 32″ tall. Newborn cubs weigh an average of 5.25-10.5 oz.</p>
    
    <h2>Adaptations</h2>
    
    <p>The cheetahs physical adaptations mostly help the cheetah run faster and help it catch its prey.The cheetah has padded claws and semi-retractable claws for traction while it is running. The cheetah has large nostrils and lungs so it can take air in quickly. It also has light bones and a light body so it can run faster.</p>
    
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    
    <p>Cheetahs are rather dog-like, medium-sized spotted cats with long legs and slender, but muscular, bodies. They have a white belly, and a dark stripe that looks like a tear on both sides of their faces. In contrast to leopards, which have palmette shaped spots, cheetahs have round dark spots on their fur.</p>
    
    <h2>Where do they live?</h2>
    
    <p>Cheetahs are mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa and in eastern and southern African parks. Some of the animals can still be found in southern Algeria, northern Niger and Iran. They like dry, open grasslands where they can pick up speed to kill prey.</p>
    
    <h2>Speed</h2>
    <p>The world's fastest land animal, the cheetah can go from 0 to 65 km (40 mi) per hour in three strides, with a single stride covering 7-8 meters (23-26 feet).</p>
